# Brown-Exponential-Smoothing
Brown Exponential Smoothing implementation in PowerBI by using DAX

The Brownian model, also known as the random walk or Wiener process, is a statistical model used to represent random, unpredictable changes over time. When combined with exponential smoothing, it provides a robust method for forecasting time series data by applying diminishing weights to past observations. This approach allows for more recent data points to have a greater influence on the prediction, making it suitable for dynamic systems where trends and patterns evolve rapidly. Exponential smoothing helps to reduce noise and highlight underlying trends, offering a more accurate and responsive forecasting model.

Alpha (Œ±) is a parameter that controls the weighting of recent observations in the smoothing process:

A higher value of ùõº (close to 1) places more weight on recent data, making the model highly responsive to changes but also more sensitive to noise.
A lower value of ùõº (closer to 0) places more weight on past data, creating a smoother trend that reacts more slowly to changes.
By selecting an appropriate ùõº, the model can be fine-tuned to balance responsiveness and stability, making it effective for various forecasting scenarios.
